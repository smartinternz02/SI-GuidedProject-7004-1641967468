# Expense-Tracker

In todayâ€™s busy and expensive life we are in a great rush to make money.
But at the end of the month, we broke off. As we are unknowingly spending money on little and unwanted things.
So, we have come over with the idea to track our earnings.
The daily expense tracker aims to help everyone who is planning to know their expenses and save from it.
An expense tracker is a spring boot app that users can access from URL and update their daily expenses so that they are well known for their expenses.
Here users can choose categories for expense types like food, clothing, rent, and bills where they have to enter the money that has been spent and also can add some information in additional information to specify the expense.
Users will be able to see graphs of expenses
Users can save those graphs for their own reference
